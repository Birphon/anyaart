           This is a fan-made website project created to display the webcomic "A Specter of Love" in an easy-to-read format. 
           The artist, Anya Art, had posted a "SFW" version onto Tapas however this has not been updated since August, however, 
           their Twitter has been more active with NSFW version of the comic but due to Twitter's "Newest First" for their posts, 
           it makes reading comic's difficult to read so this website has been made as a placeholder, 
           in order to give to the artist as a means of webhosting themselves. The artist has not been contacted for this work,
           however contact has been made in the hopes that this project can be kept alive with their consent, even uploading
           their own files for better quality.
           <br>
           <b>This project can and will be taken down at their request. I do not own any of the artworks nor do I make money from this.</b>
